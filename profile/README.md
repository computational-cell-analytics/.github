The [Computational Cell Analytics](https://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~pape41/) group is located at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and is lead by Prof. Dr. Constantin Pape.

We build deep learning based software for biomedical image analysis.
Our group creates both [tools](#tools) for specific image analysis tasks and [libraries](#libraries) that offer general purpose image analysis functionality.

## Tools

- `micro_sam` specializes Segment Anything for Microscopy data by providing finetuned models and a napari plugin.
    - [Repository](https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam)
    - [Documentation](https://computational-cell-analytics.github.io/micro-sam/micro_sam.html)
    - [Publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02580-4)
- `SynapseNet` offers segmentation networks and a napari plugin for analyzing synapses in electron micrographs.
    - [Repository](https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/synapse-net)
